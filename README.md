# PulseStrategy's $PLSTR ON ETH

 
$PLSTR is designed to mirror $MSTR but by accumulating and leveraging PulseChain as a reserve asset instead of btc.



# Core Features 

• Users deposit vPLS during a 180-day issuance period to issue PLSTR redeemable for a proportional amount of the Vpls in the contract at anytime.

• After issuance PLSTR is likely to trade on secondary markets at discounts and premiums compared to its redeemable vPLS value which savy users can take advantage of.

• When market demand drives PLSTR price above its redeemable value (a premium), it signals an opportunity to grow the vPLS reserve by expanding supply and capturing market premiums.

• When premiums are captured they are Bridged to PulseChain increasing the bridge’s Total Value Locked (TVL).

• Then exchanged for PLS, which is staked with Vouch for vPLS supporting PulseChain’s network security

• The newly acquired vPLS is bridged back to Ethereum and deposited into the contract, increasing the redeemable vPLS value of PLSTR.

• Higher reserves enhance PLSTR value, potentially driving further premiums, enabling more expansion and continuing the cycle.



# Why $PLSTR brings value to holders

PulseStrategy is offering PLSTR holders a way to make fees, yield, and expose Ethereum users to PulseChain assets, all while never taking value from PulseChain and only adding value too it.

Key benefits include:

• Increased vPLS reserves enhance the value of PLSTR potentially driving market values even higher. 

• Holders can redeem for a proportional amount of vPLS at anytime.

• PulseStrategy helps to strengthen PulseChain’s validator network improving security and decentralization.

• Built with OpenZeppelin’s audited libraries, reentrancy protection, and event logging, PulseStrategy ensures safety and visibility. 

• View functions (e.g., getVPLSBackingRatio) provide real-time insights into reserves and backing.
