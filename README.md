# PulseStrategy Overview


PulseStrategy is an ERC20 token contract that allows users to issue and redeem PLSTR backed by vPLS (Vouch-staked PLS) from PulseChain.

This is a Ethereum defi product designed to have direct synergy with Pulsechain.

The contract incorporates security measures such as reentrancy protection and uses OpenZeppelin's standard libraries for ERC20 functionality and safe token handling.


# Features

Issuance: Users may deposit vPLS to issue themselves PLSTR (-0.5%fee) during the first 180 days.

Half of the 0.5% fee collected will go to provide liquidity.

Redemption: Users can redeem PLSTR to receive a proportional amount of vPLS at any time.


# What's PulseStrategy All About?


The goal of this DeFi product is to grow PulseChain and reward PLSTR holders.

PLSTR is always redeemable for vPLS directly tying it to PulseChain.

vPLS continues earning validator rewards from PulseChain even while backing PLSTR on ETH.

PLSTR will always be redeemable for at least 1:1 vPLS but has a high chance after issuance ends of secondary market volitility, creating discounts and premiums for users to take advantage of.

Any participation directly strengthens PulseChain by exposing Ethereum users to PulseChain assets, helping the protocol capture value from Ethereum and bring it to PulseChain.
