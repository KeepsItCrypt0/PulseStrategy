# PulseStrategy's xBOND
 
This readme provides a comprehensive overview of xBOND, its mechanics, and why it offers value to holders.



# Core Features

• Token Issuance: issue xBOND by depositing PLSX during a 120-day period.

• Liquidity Pool: 5% Fee on xBOND issuance funds a xBOND/PLSX pool and is given back over time.

• Transfer Tax: 5% tax on xBOND transfers. (5% to $PLSTR, 20% burned, and 75% swapped to PLSX an reinvested into reserves)

• Redemption: Redeem xBOND for proportional amount of PLSX in contract balance.




# Why Invest in xBOND?



Passive Value Growth:

• The 5% transfer tax ensures continuous accumulation of PLSX in the contract and deflation of xBOND, increasing the backing value of each xBOND.

• the 5% issuance fee used to provide liquidity is given back over time to xBOND holders by the strategy periodically withdrawing 5% of held lp token then swaping xBOND to PLSX and adding PLSX to reserves 


Deflationary Mechanics:

• Share redemption burns xBOND tokens, reducing total supply and potentially Increasing the value of remaining tokens.

• 20% of the transfer tax is burned making xbond deflationary.

• Lower supply, combined with growing PLSX reserves, enhances the per-share backing ratio.



Accessible Entry and Exit:

• Users can issue themselves xBOND during the 120-day issuance period with a reasonable minimum deposit (10 PLSX).

• Redemption is available anytime,
providing flexibility to exit with PLSX proportional to the contract's balance.

• Transparent operations via event logs and view functions build trust and engagement.




# Why xBOND Earns Value for Holders



Transfer Tax Redistribution:

• Every xBOND transfer incurs 5% tax, of which 75% is swapped for PLSX and held by the contract's reserves.

• This increases the contract's PLSX balance, directly boosting the redeemable value per xBOND share

• 20% of the transfer tax is burned making xbond deflationary and increases the PLSX per xBOND ratio.




The xBOND protocol offers a compelling DeFi investment opportunity by combining tax redistribution, burns, and a bonded asset to create value for holders. 

Its transparent mechanics and secure design make it an attractive option for both new and seasoned DeFi participants.

By holding xBOND, users can benefit from passive PLSX accumulation and deflationary tokenomics all while retaining the flexibility to redeem PLSX at any time.
